              This document will outline all the necessary requirements of Flick and provide a detailed overview of the features and functionality of the service. The information provided is geared towards the interests of the end user and the working project team, who will utilize the document as a reference throughout the development of the platform. Given the bifurcation of the intended audience, the document will aim to be sufficiently detailed and simple, so as to be meaningful to all parties.

            <p>
              Flick is a web-based application designed to solve the age-long problem of picking a movie. The service will display movie titles, trailers, and descriptions, upon which users can swipe right (like) or swipe left (dislike) based on their interests. On the back-end, data will be collected on the habits and preferences of each individual and be applied to the database in order to refine the selection of movies displayed to the user, simplifying the selection process. The platform’s hallmark functionality is the formation of viewing groups, which will be referred to as “theatres”, in which the preferences of the individuals in the viewing audience are aggregated and used to display a list of movies of common interest to the group. If a movie of interest is not found, users will be prompted to continue swiping, updating the selection of films displayed to the theatre.

              Flick is a web-based application that uses React to create a front-end. It will utilize a manually created database that is based on a catalogue of various movies. However, this model can later be extended to other streaming services. A back-end database will also be used to enable user preference and movie organization.

          <h3>2.1.1 User Interface</h3>
          <div class="subsection-info subsubsection">
            <p>
              Within the Flick web-app there are nine main user interfaces: login screen, sign-up screen, user profile section, movie selection, view theatres, view theatre matches, theatre creations, theatre renaming, and notifications. When a user accesses the app, they will be shown the login/sign-up screen.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Login:</b> The login menu will be displayed each time the application has been opened, containing an input box for both a username and password. The log-in page will also contain a button to create a new profile.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Sign-up:</b> Users will be prompted to complete a form with username and password fields, and a checklist of different genres to be selected. A Submit button will be displayed at the bottom of the form.              
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>User Profile:</b> The user profile will be created for each unique user that has created an account on Flick. Within their profile, users will have the ability to update their username, age, movie genre preferences and view their previously selected movies (those they have swiped right on). The profile page will be divided into three sections for changes to user personal information, changes to genre preferences, and theatre match history.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Movie Selection:</b> Once the user has created their profile, they can begin swiping on the movies they like. Users will be presented with a movie on the screen based on age-appropriateness and their preferences, and they can either swipe left if they don’t want to watch the movie, or swipe right if they do. Swiping will be done using the keyboard keys or by clicking on the respective buttons below the movie details. The user can continue swiping through movies until there is a common movie selected between their group.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>View Theatres:</b> Users will be able to view a list of all the theatres that they have joined and members within those theatres. They will also be able to create new theatres and add new members, which would prompt the theatre creation screen. Additionally, users can edit and leave theatres by opening a collapsed menu and selecting the corresponding option.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>View Theatre Matches:</b> Opening a specific theatre will show a list of its theatre matches.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Theatre Creation:</b> Users will be able to create their own theatres, including naming the group and adding in users to join. This interface will include fields for the theatre name and list of members. To add a new group member, users will search for the respective usernames in a search bar and select the desired user(s) to be added to the list.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Theatre Renaming:</b> Users will be able to rename their own theatres by opening a collapsed menu and selecting the rename option on the theatre’s page. This will prompt a form with an editable text field for the theatre name, and Confirm and Cancel buttons. 
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Notifications:</b> Users will be notified of new theatre matches, changes to theatre members, and invitations to new theatres. Clicking on the Notifications button will open a list of recent notifications, each marked as either new or already viewed.

              Flick provides the user with the ability to create a profile containing movie preferences, create theatres, and select movies that they would enjoy watching. Selection will occur by users’ swiping left or right. Users will only see a single movie at a time during selection. Users will select movies based on their own preferences, which will be added to an individual list. The individual lists of all theatre members will be compiled and overlapping movies will be used for the theatre matches. In the theatre matches, theatre members will only be able to view movies that their theatre would like to watch (i.e. similar genres).

              The intended audience are movie watchers that have access to
              Streaming Platforms. Flick users can have any educational
              background and should have the required technical expertise to be
              able to navigate the basic functions of their browsers. Users who
              have previous experience using the dating app Tinder will minimize
              the amount of time spent needed to become familiar with Flick, as
              the swiping functions are similar.

            <p>
              Flick requires a comprehensive list of movies available on various Streaming Platforms. This list will be stored on a manually created database, which requires time to build. Building the database will require a back-end function that will allow us to input the necessary movie data. As a result of funding concerns, the amount of movies that can be stored in a database and user information will be more limited. Additionally, as each user will make multiple requests to the database for movie suggestions, we may need to implement a delay to reduce request speeds and to compensate for simultaneous requests.

            <p>
              We assume the user will be able to connect to the internet while using the Flick app to successfully interact with the movie database. Another assumption is that users will be accessing Flick on a Chromium-based browser with JavaScript enabled to be compatible with all webapp functions. We are also going to assume that there are movies that exist to satisfy the preferences of all members in a created theatre. Finally, we assume that users are in external contact to physically view the movies and exchange user information to form a theatre.

              Upon a login attempt, the system will check if the username and password exist in the database. If the username or password is incorrect, the system will prompt the user to try again or to create an account if they do not already have one. When creating an account, the system checks if the username and password are valid and if the username is unique amongst existing usernames in the database. On the movie selection page, movies are pulled from the database and displayed to the user, filtered based on a movie genre preferences algorithm. The system will store all movies the user swipes positively/negatively on in the database for the purposes of matching within theatres and ensuring that a user does not get repeatedly shown the same movie. The system also has the capability to check if a movie is commonly liked by all members of the user’s theatre. The theatre matches page will pull all the user’s theatres, theatre members, and commonly liked movies in theatres from the database and display it to the user. If a theatre has no commonly liked movies, it will prompt the user to keep swiping on movies to find one. When creating a new theatre on the theatre creation page, the system checks if the theatre name is valid and if the usernames of the users they invite exist in the database. Users who receive theatre invites can accept them on the notifications page and this will update them as a member of the theatre in the database, which is displayed on the theatre matches page.

              Our database will store information of users, theatres, and movies. Users will have a username, password, list of genre preferences, list of liked movies, list of theatres they are a member of, and a list of notifications. Theatres will have a theatre name, list of members in the theatre, and a list of commonly liked movies by all members of the theatre. Movies will have a movie name, list of genres, and rating.
