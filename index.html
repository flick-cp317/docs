              This document will outline all the necessary requirements of Flick
              and provide a detailed overview of the features and functionality
              of the service. The information provided is geared towards the
              interests of the end user and the working project team, who will
              utilize the document as a reference throughout the development of
              the service. Given the bifurcation of the intended audience, the
              document will aim to be sufficiently detailed and simple, so as to
              be meaningful to all parties.

            <p>
              Flick is a web-based application designed to solve the age-long
              problem of picking a movie. The service will display movie titles,
              trailers, and descriptions, upon which users can swipe right
              (like) or swipe left (dislike) based on their interests. On the
              back end, data will be collected on the habits and preferences of
              each individual and be applied to the database in order to refine
              the selection of movies displayed to the group, simplifying the
              selection process. The platform’s hallmark functionality is the
              formation of viewing groups, which will be referred to as
              “Theatres”, in which the preferences of the individuals in the
              viewing audience are aggregated and used to display a list of
              movies of common interest to the group. If a movie of interest is
              not found, users will be prompted to continue swiping, updating
              the selection of films displayed to the theatre.

              Flick is a web-based application that uses React to create a front
              end. It will utilize a manually created database that is based on
              a catalogue of Netflix movies. However, this model can later be
              extended to other streaming services. A back end database will
              also be used to enable user preference and movie organization.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>2.1.1 User Interface</h3>
          <div class="subsection-info subsubsection">
            <p>
              Within the Flick web-app there are six main user interfaces:
              Login/sign up screen, user profile, movie selection, theatre
              matches, theatre creations, and notifications. When a user
              accesses the app, they will be shown the login/sign up screen.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Login:</b> The login menu will be displayed each time the
              application has been opened, containing an input box for both a
              username and password. The log-in page will also contain a button
              to create a new profile.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>User Profile:</b> The user profile will be created for each
              unique user that has created an account on Flick. Within their
              profile, users will have the ability to input their username, age,
              movie genre preferences and view their previously selected movies
              (those they have swiped right on). Whenever a new user log-ins for
              the first time, they will be able to create a new user profile,
              which can be updated at any time.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Movie selection:</b> Once the user has created their profile,
              they can begin swiping on the movies they like. Users will be
              presented with a movie on the screen based on age-appropriateness
              and their preferences, and they can either swipe left if they
              don’t want to watch the movie, or swipe right if they do. The user
              can continue swiping through movies until there is a common movie
              selected between their group.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Theatre Matches:</b> Users will be able to view all of the
              theatres that they have joined and members within those theatres.
              They will also be able to create new theatres and add new members,
              which would prompt the theatre creation screen. Opening a specific
              theatre will show that theatre’s movie matches. Additionally,
              users can edit and leave theatres.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Theatre creation:</b> Users will be able to create their own
              theatres, including naming the group and adding in users to join.
              To add a new group member, users will search for the respective
              usernames in a search bar and be able to add them into their
              theatre.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Notifications:</b> Users will be notified of new Movie Matches,
              changes to Theatre members, and invitations to new Theatres.

              Flick provides the user with the ability to create a profile
              containing movie preferences, create groups (Theatres), and select
              movies that they would enjoy watching. Selection will occur by
              users’ swiping left or right. Users will only see a single movie
              at a time during selection. Users will select movies based on
              their own preferences, which will be added to an individual list.
              The individual lists of all theatre members will be compiled and
              overlapping movies will be used for the Theatre Matches. In the
              Theatre Matches, Theatre members will only be able to view movies
              that their Theatre would like to watch (i.e. similar genres).

            <p>
              The intended audience are movie watchers that have access to
              Streaming Platforms. Flick users can have any educational
              background and should have the required technical expertise to be
              able to navigate the basic functions of their browsers. Users who
              have previous experience using the dating app Tinder will minimize
              the amount of time spent needed to become familiar with Flick, as
              the swiping functions are similar.

          <div class="subsection-info">
            <p>
              Flick requires a comprehensive list of movies available on various
              Streaming Platforms. This list will be stored on a manually
              created database, which requires time to build. Building the
              database will require a third-party API to extract the data from
              Netflix, and will depend on the API remaining functional with any
              future updates to the streaming services. Additionally, as each
              user will make multiple requests to the database for movie
              suggestions, we may need to implement a delay to reduce request
              speeds and to compensate for simultaneous requests.

            <p>
              We assume the user will be able to connect to the internet while
              using the Flick app to successfully interact with the movie
              database. Another assumption is that users will be accessing Flick
              on a Chromium browser to be compatible with all web app functions.
              Finally we assume that users are in external contact to physically
              view the movies and exchange user information to form a Theater.
              We are also going to assume that there are movies that exist to
              satisfy the preferences of all members in a created theater.

              When the user opens the app, they are presented with the login
              page. Once the user logs in with their username and password, they
              go to the movie selection page. On the movie selection page users
              like or dislike movies one by one. On the theatre matches page the
              user can click on a theatre that they are in to see commonly liked
              movies by other members of the theatre. From this page users will
              also be able to edit, leave, and create new theatres. Creating a
              new theatre will redirect the user to the theatre creation page.
              On this page users can create new theatres by giving the theatre a
              name and sending theatre invites to other users by username. Users
              who receive theatre invites will find these invites on their
              notifications page. On this page users will have the option to
              accept or deny theatre invites. Any theatres the user joins will
              appear on their theatre matches page. Lastly, on the user profile
              page users can edit their username and genre preferences.

              On the login page the system will check if the username and
              password exist in the database. If the username or password is
              incorrect the system will prompt the user to try again or to
              create an account if they do not already have one. When creating
              an account, the system checks if the username and password are
              valid and if the username is unique amongst existing usernames in
              the database. On the movie selection page, movies are pulled from
              the database and displayed to the user filtered based on a movie
              genre preferences algorithm. The system will store all movies the
              user likes in the database. The system will also check if this
              movie is commonly liked by all members of the user’s theatre. The
              theatre matches page will pull all the user’s theatres, theatre
              members, and commonly liked movies in theatres from the database
              and display it to the user. If a theatre has no commonly liked
              movies it will prompt the user to keep swiping on movies to find
              one. When creating a new theatre on the theatre creation page the
              system checks if the theatre name is valid and the usernames of
              the users they invite exist in the database. Users who receive
              theatre invites can accept them on the notifications page and this
              will update them as a member of the theatre in the database which
              is displayed on the theatre matches page.

              Our database will store information of users, theatres, and
              movies. Users will have a username, password, list of genre
              preferences, list of liked movies, list of theatres they are a
              member of, and a list of notifications. Theatres will have a
              theatre name, list of members in the theatre, and a list of
              commonly liked movies by all members of the theatre. Movies will
              have a movie name, list of genres, and some other related movie
              information.
